Please note:
1. Scraping this website is only allowed for personal use.
2. Given the "sleep" intervals embedded in the code, it gently scrapes the pages so it will take a while to complete the operation.
3. From observation, each results page contains 18 listings. It extracts variables from each property listing, and saves to a excel file for further analysis.
